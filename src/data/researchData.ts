## Current Policy Stance

- Terminal rate around 4.50-4.75%
- Data-dependent approach

**Key Factors to Watch**

2. **Labor Market Cooling**: Gradual softening without sharp deterioration
3. **Economic Growth**: Avoiding recession while maintaining stability

## Market Implications

**Bond Markets**

- Long-term rates may decline
- Credit spreads likely to tighten

**Equity Markets**
- Rate-sensitive sectors may outperform
- Growth stocks could benefit from lower discount rates

## Investment Strategy Considerations

Given the evolving policy landscape:

3. **International Exposure**: Diversify as dollar strength moderates
4. **Credit Quality**: Maintain focus on high-quality issuers

## Conclusion

The Fed's pivot toward a more accommodative stance represents a significant shift in the monetary policy cycle. Investors should prepare for increased volatility as markets adjust to changing rate expectations while remaining vigilant for data that could alter the policy trajectory.
